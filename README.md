# myhabeetat-oauth

This project is an OAuth 2.0 adapter for MyHabeetat's (including BGH Smart Control devices) cloud platform. It provides the required endpoints to adapt MyHabeetat's cloud authentication method to one that complies with the OAuth 2.0 standard.

It was created to be used with [this](https://github.com/tmigone/alexa-skill-my-habeetat) Alexa custom Skill, but should work with any service that requires OAuth authentication.

Note: You don't need to deploy or configure this project if you want to control BGH Smart Control devices with the Alexa skill linked above.
